https://pokeguess-rust.vercel.app/
A little game for guessing the name of pokemon. 
Pokemon are included up to Pokemon Sword and Shield (905). 

# Rules 
You will have three lifes and by mistake you will lose one. 
In case you want, you could play in hard mode, where you will only have one life. 

# Technologies 
This project are made with React.js and Vite. Regarding the styles I use NESS.css (https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/). 
To fetch the pokemon data I use PokeApi (https://pokeapi.co/).

# Hosting
The application is hosted by Vercel and continuous deploy.
